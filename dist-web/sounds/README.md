# Sound Files

This directory contains notification sound files for the restaurant POS system.

## Required Sound Files

The following sound files should be placed in this directory:

- `new-order.mp3` - Played when a new aggregator order arrives
- `order-ready.mp3` - Played when an order is marked as ready
- `urgent.mp3` - Played for urgent/overdue orders
- `completed.mp3` - Played when an order is completed
- `error.mp3` - Played when an error occurs

## File Format

- **Format**: MP3
- **Recommended length**: 1-3 seconds
- **Volume**: Pre-normalized to -3dB to -6dB

## Adding Custom Sounds

You can replace these files with your own notification sounds. Make sure to:

1. Keep the same filenames
2. Use MP3 format for broad browser compatibility
3. Keep files small (< 50KB) for faster loading
4. Test volume levels to ensure they're audible but not jarring

## License

Ensure you have the right to use any custom sound files in a commercial application.

## Placeholder

Currently, these are placeholder paths. The actual sound files will be added in Phase 6 or can be customized by the restaurant owner.
